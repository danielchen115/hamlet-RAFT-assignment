			<p>The story of Hamlet has certainly withstood the test of time, continuing to be a staple read across the world and in every English class across the nation. It has been studied for centuries and offers academic insight for years to come. With archaeologist Jamie Smith’s newest findings of journal entries from Elsinore Castle, new understanding is now available for the inner workings of past Danish loyalty, such as Polonius, Colonius, Gertrude, and of course Hamlet himself. Below are two excerpts from the journal of Polonius; Sources say this was written the night after Hamlet's sudden appearance in Ophelia's room.</p>
			<p id="journal">Hamlet has gone mad! Mad, I say! Just last evening he burst into the room of my daughter Ophelia, held her wrists, and just stared blankly at her like some crazy man. Love can do that to a man, especially for someone as beautiful as my daughter. I even warned Ophelia about how destructive a teenage boy’s love can be. “This is the very ecstasy of love; / Whose violent property fordoes itself / As oft as any passion under heaven / That does afflict our natures” (II.I.104-107).  Hamlet’s craving for Ophelia has finally cracked through his princely appearance, opening up to make way for his more unpleasant desires that can only be fulfilled by a woman. I guess I am at fault for this as well, I mean I was the one who warned her of Hamlet and told her to keep Hamlet at a distance. Either way, I must speak to the King and Queen about this tomorrow; It is only fair that they know the mental status of their son. </p>
			<p>To analyze these historical documents, famed psychologist and Shakespeare enthusiast Gregory Jones has travelled all the way from his hometown in Scotland to speak with us about this monumental find. "As in the psychoanalytical lens of Sigmund Freud, madness and hysteria is rooted in the unconscious. In the case of Hamlet, Polonius believes his hysteria is caused by an aspect of his id: The libido," says Jones. "'That does afflict our natures' is the constant desire for sexual pleasure, and Hamlet has been rejected that from Ophelia, causing his id to act up in order to satisfy his libido. Hamlet’s id has overtaken his superego and wants instant gratification, even against social acceptances. This is the only logical explanation to Polonius as to why a man of such loyal standards and upbringings would throw that all aside and abruptly appear in his daughter’s room. Of course, the true reason goes beyond that, but this is unknown to Polonius."
			<p id="journal">I spoke with the King and Queen today about the state of their son, even reading to them a love letter that Hamlet sent to Ophelia. They seemed to agree with me, that his emotions have truly taken him over the edge. This meeting with the monarch, however, was not the most intriguing part of my day. In fact, it came just moments later when I had some time alone with Hamlet himself. A strange lad, he is, confusing me for a fish seller! His mind must be confusing me purposefully, it must be a real fear of his to confront the father of his love. He speaks in a way that is much too difficult to interpret, “A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of” (II.II.200-203). He has gone beyond comprehension through social cues, and enters a happiness that only he can understand. I left him to his antics quite quickly, as I see no reason to continue speaking with someone I can barely understand. I plan to hold a meeting between Hamlet and my daughter to confirm my assumptions of his absurdity. </p>
			<p>"Polonius deems Hamlet is using denial as a defence mechanism, evident by the fact that he believed Polonius was a fish seller," explains Gregory Jones. "Subconsciously, he knows that Ophelia’s father would not approve of their relationship, and therefore believes what is true to be false and will not accept the fact that he is confronting Ophelia’s father." Furthermore, Jones claims Polonius' inability to understand Hamlet is due to the difference within their unconscious. "Polonius believes that this nonsense goes over his head because he still holds his ego, while Hamlet’s outlandish talk is speaking to the id. This ‘happiness’ does not get through the ‘reason and sanity’ of his ego, which is still doing its job of regulating Polonius’ id."</p>
			<p>There's no doubt that Polonius believed strongly that the cause of Hamlet's madness is due to his love for Ophelia. </p>
