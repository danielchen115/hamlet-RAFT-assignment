				<p>The story of Hamlet has certainly withstood the test of time, continuing to be a staple read across the world and in every English class across the nation. It has been studied for centuries and offers academic insight for years to come. With archaeologist Jamie Smith’s newest findings of journal entries from Elsinore Castle, new understanding is now available for the inner workings of past Danish loyalty, such as Polonius, Colonius, Gertrude, and of course Hamlet himself. Below are two excerpts from the journal of Polonius; Sources say this was written the night after Hamlet's sudden appearance in Ophelia's room.</p>
				<h6>Cited from Polonius' journal:</h6>
				<p id="journal">Hamlet has gone mad! Mad, I say! Just last evening he burst into the room of my daughter Ophelia, held her wrists, and just stared blankly at her like some crazy man. Love can do that to a man, especially for someone as beautiful as my daughter. I even warned Ophelia about how destructive a boy’s love can be. “This is the very ecstasy of love; / Whose violent property fordoes itself / As oft as any passion under heaven / That does afflict our natures” (II.I.104-107).  Hamlet’s craving for Ophelia has finally cracked through his princely appearance, opening up to make way for his more unpleasant desires that can only be fulfilled by a woman. I guess I am at fault for this as well, I mean I was the one who warned her of Hamlet and told her to keep Hamlet at a distance. Either way, I must speak to the King and Queen about this tomorrow; It is only fair that they know the mental status of their son. </p>
				<p>To analyze these historical documents, famed psychologist and Shakespeare enthusiast Gregory Jones has travelled all the way from his hometown in Scotland to speak with us about this monumental find. "As in the psychoanalytical lens of Sigmund Freud, madness and hysteria is rooted in the unconscious. In the case of Hamlet, Polonius believes his hysteria is caused by an aspect of his id: The libido," says Jones. "'That does afflict our natures' is the constant desire for sexual pleasure, and Hamlet has been rejected that from Ophelia, causing his id to act up in order to satisfy his libido. Hamlet’s id has overtaken his superego and wants instant gratification, even against social acceptances. This is the only logical explanation to Polonius as to why a man of such loyal standards and upbringings would throw that all aside and abruptly appear in his daughter’s room. Of course, the true reason goes beyond that, but this is unknown to Polonius."

				<p id="journal">I spoke with the King and Queen today about the state of their son, even reading to them a love letter that Hamlet sent to Ophelia. They seemed to agree with me, that his emotions have truly taken him over the edge. This meeting with the monarch, however, was not the most intriguing part of my day. In fact, it came just moments later when I had some time alone with Hamlet himself. A strange lad, he is, confusing me for a fish seller! His mind must be confusing me purposefully, it must be a real fear of his to confront the father of his love. He speaks in a way that is much too difficult to interpret, “A happiness that often / madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so / prosperously be delivered of” (II.II.208-210). He has gone beyond comprehension through social cues, and enters a happiness that only he can understand. I left him to his antics quite quickly, as I see no reason to continue speaking with someone I can barely understand. I plan to hold a meeting between Hamlet and my daughter to confirm my assumptions of his absurdity. </p>
				<p>"Polonius deems Hamlet is using denial as a defence mechanism, evident by the fact that he believed Polonius was a fish seller," explains Gregory Jones. "Subconsciously, he knows that Ophelia’s father would not approve of their relationship, and therefore believes what is true to be false and will not accept the fact that he is confronting Ophelia’s father." Furthermore, Jones claims Polonius' inability to understand Hamlet is due to the difference within their unconscious. "Polonius believes that this nonsense goes over his head because he still holds his ego, while Hamlet’s outlandish talk is speaking to the id. This ‘happiness’ does not get through the ‘reason and sanity’ of his ego, which is still doing its job of regulating Polonius’ id."</p>
				<p>There's no doubt that Polonius believed strongly that the cause of Hamlet's madness is due to his love for Ophelia, though his Queen and mother Gertrude has other ideas. Below is a page taken from Gertrude's journal on the same day.</p>
				<h6>Cited from Gertrude's journal:</h6>
				<p id="journal">Oh, my son! How things have changed… From such a young and cheerful soul with such a brilliant mind, all to insanity in the span of just a few months. Today I heard stories from Polonius, how his change is due to heartbreak… However, “I doubt it is no other but the main: / His father’s death and our o'erhasty marriage” ( II.II.56-57). Hamlet had such a strong connection to his father, and for him to leave so suddenly… God it must have been so hard on him. My quick marriage to his father didn’t make things better, either. He was bound to resent the replacement for such a key character in his life. Old Hamlet and Claudius are also quite different as fathers, I guess he hasn’t transitioned to embrace a new father figure. Well, all we can do now is wait. It’s not like I can bring Old Hamlet back. Hopefully he regains his sanity, what a shame for such an astute scholar and prince to lose his mind.</p>
				<p>“Gertrude has quite a different approach for the reason of Hamlet’s madness,” says Jones. “She believes that his familial circumstances, specifically that of his father, is the influence that lead to his mental instability. A father often acts as an external ego and super ego to their child. In this way, a father regulates the id of their child and keeps their psyche in line. With the death of his father, Gertrude speculates that Hamlet’s id is now able to run free with nothing supressing it, and therefore is expressed through his madness. She also believes that this madness is amplified by a new, yet fake, father figure in his life. By filling the hole in Hamlet’s life, he is also projecting his unwanted feelings of loss and his past expectations to Gertrude’s new wife and Hamlet’s new father, Claudius.”</p>
				<p>Mr. Smith also dug up the royal journal entries of the king himself, King Claudius. He has a darker take on this whole ordeal, and it is reflected in his journal entries. Research confirms that these were written the night of Polonius' murder and before Hamlet is sent off to England.</p>
				<h6>Cited from Caludius' journal:</h6>
				<p id="journal">A snake in the grass, that little Hamlet is! How he has tricked every man and woman in this court, from the late Polonius to my very own wife. Lovesick? Only a fool would believe that this murderous villain is lovesick. He knows something… Something that he shouldn’t know. It is best I get rid of him as soon as possible. I have sent him to England, with two of his colleagues. Hopefully, their King receives my memo and that will be the last I hear from him. My lovely wife believes that Hamlet’s madness is what caused him to murder Polonius, which is all too convenient. I claimed that I must send Hamlet off for his own safety, to help with his ‘madness.’ I told him “Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, / Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve / For that which though hast done, must send thee hence / With fiery quickness” (IV.III.41-44). Two can play this game of trickery, and I am the one who will have the last laugh.</p>
				<p>Gregory Jones agrees that Claudius holds a different stance to Hamlet’s illness compared to that of Gertrude and Polonius. “Claudius is able to see through his insane-like persona that others ironically mistake for his shadow,” Jones points out. “He knows that Hamlet is using an antic disposition to reflect and excuse his deeper and darker uncivilized characteristics. To fight this, Claudius too must also put on a persona of care and worry for his son, using Hamlet’s clever persona against him by deterring suspicion through his ‘loving’ actions of sending him away for his own safety. During the standoff between the two, Hamlet represents Thanatos, speaking of death in Polonius and hinting at the death of Claudius. Claudius however, represents Eros through his talks of Hamlet’s safety his love for him. In this way, Claudius appears to have higher moral ground and makes his decision to ship Hamlet off to England even more justifiable."  </p>
				<p>These three journal entries have provided three very different outlooks on the actions of one very unique person. This amazing find gives scholars all over the world a great deal of substance to work with, and opens doors for many more observations. Archaeologists are still at the site looking for more clues to unravel the most merited story in English literature.</p>
